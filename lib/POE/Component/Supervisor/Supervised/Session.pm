            );

=item handle_class

The class to instantiate.

Defaults to L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Handle::Session>.

Note that attributes are inherited only from
L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Handle::Session>. If your handle class requires
additional attributes, you must subclass your own C<Supervised> variant.

The C<_inherit_attributes_from_handle_class> method can then be invoked on your
subclass to reinherit all the attributes. Read the source of
L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised> for more details.
