=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Supervisor::Handle::Proc - A supervisor child handle for a POSIXish process.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # created by POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These objects manage a real UNIX process (signalling, monitoring) within a
L<POE::Component::Supervisor>.

=head1 SIGNALLING

In order to kill a child process first the child's standard input is closed,
then the C<TERM> signal is sent, and after a wait period the C<KILL> signal is
sent.

If the child has not died by the time the C<KILL> loop times out then an error
is thrown (this happens under weird OS scenarios and shouldn't happen
normally).

The attributes C<until_term>, C<until_kill> and C<wait_for> determine the
durations of these loops.

Initially inputs will be closed. Then, after C<until_term> seconds have passed
the C<TERM> sending loop will start, sending the C<TERM> signal with an
exponential backoff.

When C<until_kill> seconds have passed, from the time of the C<stop> method
being called, the C<TERM> loop will be stopped, and instead the C<KILL> signal
will be sent, also with an exponential backoff.

From the time of the C<stop> method being called the handle will wait for a
maximum of C<wait_for> seconds before giving up on the child process.

ANy of these attributes may be set to C<undef> to disable their corresponding
behaviors (suppress sending of a certain signal, or wait indefinitely).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

B<NOTE>: All the attributes are generally passsed in by
L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc>, the factory for this class.

They are documented here because that is where their behavior is defined.

L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc> will borrow all the attributes
from this class that have an C<init_arg>, and as such they should be passed to
L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc/new>, while this class is never
instantiated directly..

=over 4

=item until_term

The time to wait after closing inputs, and before sending the C<TERM> signal.
Defaults to one tenth of a second.

Set to C<undef> to disable sending the C<TERM> signal.

=item until_kill

The time to wait after closing inputs, and before sending the C<KILL> signal.
Defaults to 10 seconds.

Set to C<undef> to disable sending the C<KILL> signal.

=item wait_for

How long to keep sending exit signals for.

Defaults to

    5 + ( $self->until_kill || $self->until_term || 0 )

=item enable_nested_poe

Whether or not to call L<POE::Kernel/stop> in the child program, before the
callback. Only applies to code references.

This allows a nested POE kernel to be started in the forked environment without
needing to C<exec> a new program.

Defaults to true.

=item start_nested_poe

Whether or not to call L<POE::Kernel/run> in the child program, after the callback. Only applies to
code references.

Defaults to true.

=item program

A coderef or an array ref. Passed as the C<Program> parameter to the wheel, but
may be wrapped depending on the values of C<enable_nested_poe> and
C<start_nested_poe> if it's a code ref.

Required.

=item wheel_parameters

Additional parameters to pass to L<POE::Wheel::Run/new>.

=item stdin_callback

=item stdout_callback

=item stderr_callback

Callbacks to be fired when the corresponding L<POE::Wheel::Run> events are
handled.

This only affects the default event handlers, if you ovverride those by passing
your own C<wheel_parameters> these callbacks will never take effect.

The arguments are passed through as is, see L<POE::Wheel::Run> for the details.

Not required.

=item pid

Read only attribute containing the process ID.

=item exited

=item exit_code

=item exit_signal

After the process has exited these read only attributes are filled in with the exit information.

C<exited> is the raw value of C<$?>, and C<exit_code> and C<exit_signal> are
the values of applying C<WEXITSTATUS> and C<WTERMSIG> to that value.

See L<POSIX> for details.

=item use_logger_singleton

Changes the default value of the original L<MooseX::LogDispatch> attribute to
true.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

Never called directly, but called by L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc>.

=item stop

Stop the running process

=item is_running

Check whether or not the process is still running.

=back

=head1 EVENTS

All L<POE> events supported by this object are currently internal, and as such
the session corresponding to this object provides no useful L<POE> interface.
