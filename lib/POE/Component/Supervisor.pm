=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Supervisor - Erlang inspired babysitting

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POE;

    use POE::Component::Supervisor;

    POE::Component::Supervisor->new(
        children => [
            POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Proc->new( ... ),    # monitor UNIX procs
            POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised::Session->new( ... ), # monitor POE sessions
        ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a port of the Erlang process supervisor
(L<http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html>).

This will monitor instances of children, restarting them as necessary should
they exit.

Restart throttling is not yet implemented but planned for a future version.

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

A supervisor has any number of supervised child descriptors, which in turn
instantiate handles for each spawned instance of the child.

Supervised children are essential object factories for handles. They spawn new
instances of the child they describe by instantiating handles.

A handle will do the actual management of the child, sending events to the
supervisor when the child is terminated, and also facilitate explicit
termination of the child's instance.

Based on its C<restart_policy> the supervisor may order other handles to also
stop, and ask various child descriptors to respawn certain children.

=head1 POE REFERENCE COUNTING

When no more children are being supervised the L<POE> reference count for the
supervisor's session will go down to zero. If no C<alias> is set up then the
session will close. If an C<alias> is set and no other sessions are doing
anything the session will also close. See L<POE>, and L<MooseX::POE::Aliased>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item alias

See L<MooseX::POE::Aliased>.

This defaults to C<undef>, unlike the role, so that a supervisor session will
close automatically once it has no more children to supervise.

=item use_logger_singleton

See L<MooseX::LogDispatch>.

Changes the default to true, to allow usage of an already configured
L<Log::Dispatch::Config> setup.

=item restart_policy

This is one of C<one>, C<all> or C<rest>.

If the L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised> object describing the child
deems the child should be restarted, then the value of this attribute controls
which other children to also restart.

C<one> denotes that only the child which died will be restarted.

C<rest> will cause all the children appearing after the child which died in the
children array to be restarted, but not the children preceding it.

C<all> will restart all the children.

=item children

This is the array of children being supervised.

It is a required argument.

Note that the array reference will be modified if new children are introduced
and when children are removed (even during normal shutdown), so pass in a copy
of an array if this is a problem for you.

The order of the children matters, see C<restart_policy>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=item new %args

=item start @children

Spawn and supervise the children described by the descriptors in @children.

=item stop [ @children ]

Stop the specified children.

If no arguments are provided all the children are stopped.

=item should_restart_child $child, %args

Delegates to C<$child> by calling
L<POE::Component::Supervisor::Supervised/should_restart>.

=item child_exit_is_fatal

Currently always returns false. In the future restart throttling will be
implemented using this method.

If C<true> is returned an error will be thrown by the supervisor.

=head1 EVENTS

The L<POE> event api is currently internal. All manipulation of the supervisor
object should be done using the api described in L<METHODS>.
